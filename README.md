# Live Coding Challenge

Welcome to this fast Datascope live coding challenge. 

Here we have a Fantasy Dragon Ball team builder app. The objective of this app is to allow users to create the best 10-member DBZ team.

- [ ] Make the necesary changes to allow the app to add members to the team but you can't change anything in the `TeamCard.tsx` component. Team shouldn't have more than 10 members.
- [ ] Currently the list of characters come from a static file. Now they should be fetched from [Dragon Ball API](https://web.dragonball-api.com/documentation) specifically from `https://dragonball-api.com/api/characters`endpoint. Please fetch the first 30. You can use fetch API or axios.
- [ ] There are some typescript bad practices in components CharacterCard and TeamCard please fix them.
- [ ] Combined Ki is not changing when you add team members please fit it.
- [ ] Combined Ki is not being properly calculated please fix it.
